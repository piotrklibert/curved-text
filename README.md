# curved-text - simple library for drawing text along the curve

## What?

A simple library for drawing text along the cubic Bezier curves. It's probably
easier to show than describe, so here's a screenshot of DrRacket REPL showing
the library in action:

In addition to the library itself there's a little GUI demo app, which displays
a curved text and allows manipulating control points by dragging them with the
mouse:
